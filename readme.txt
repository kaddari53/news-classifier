## About The Project

Grouping articles into clusters is a basic step in many applications such as indexing,
retrieving, and browsing data on the web. Considering the huge volumes of articles, a good
method of grouping articles can organize these large numbers of articles into meaningful
groups, which allows for more navigation and navigation.
Recent trends show the need to shift to unsupervised learning where classes are to be
constructed dynamically based on the semantics of their contents. In such cases, knowledge
bases are used to augment unsupervised learning.
